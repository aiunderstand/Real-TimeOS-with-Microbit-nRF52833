# Real-TimeOS-with-Microbit-nRF52833

More examples (eg. bluetooth) can be found at https://github.com/fduignan/zephyr_bbc_microbit_v2/tree/main/zephyr_3.1.0/led_matrix/src. 

This repository adapted several examples to the new Zephyr version and syntax and added several new ones not found in that repository. These are based on the Ada version of the drivers at https://github.com/aiunderstand/Ada_Drivers_Library/tree/master/examples/MicroBit_v2/ravenscar
